- Greek strings may be constructed from either representation: the second representation is automatically generated
- only explicitly enumerated code points are accepted as valid
- equality of two Greek strings does not depend on which format was used to construct the Greek string
- comparison of two Greek strings follows the ordering of the Greek alphabet
- the library is cross compiled to run either on the JVM or a javascript engine
